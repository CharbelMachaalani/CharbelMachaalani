## My Research Journey 🗺️  

I started out as a **classic wet-lab scientist** — the pipette kind, not the laptop kind.  

My early toolkit included:  
- Western blots (yes, I’ve spilled milk)  
- RT-qPCR  
- Lentiviral transduction  
- Cell culture marathons  
- Creating *Drosophila* transgenic lines   🪰🪰🪰 
- Microscope gymnastics for tiny dissections  
- Taking fancy SEM images of fly eyes (they *are* pretty)

I loved the hands-on work, the experiments, the troubleshooting-that-turns-into-career-therapy… all of it.

### Fast-forward ⏭⏭⏭ Early 2023

I jumped into a PhD exploring **why some pediatric low-grade gliomas don’t respond to treatment**.  

This pulled me deep into the world of:  
- Molecular profiling
- Bulk sequencing    
- Spatial proteomics  
- Single-nuclei multiome (RNA + ATAC)

This all happened **despite me never taking a formal bioinformatics / CS / stats course**.  
Translation: I spent months googling what everyone else pretended to “just know.”  
But I fell in love with computational biology — and now I can’t imagine doing research without it.

## What I'm Currently Up To 🔬💻  

- Integrating multiome and spatial datasets to understand tumor evolution  
- Learning to survive (and occasionally enjoy) R, and nextflow  
- Trying to make sense of weird cell clusters 👀  
- Slowly becoming the “tech” person in the lab even though I never meant to
